# Nicole
## My "about me" repository.
# Welcome to my GitHub!
## My background:
### My name is Nicole and I have been wanting to learn to code for years! After some unexpected career changes, I have decided to take it seriously. My goal is to land a front-end developer job in the new year (2026). 
### I am learning using FreeCodeCamp.org and the Meta "introduction to front-end development" on Coursera. Most of my early repositories on here will likely be from FreeCodeCamp.org to showcase my learning and associated projects. 
## Feedback and Guidance
### If anyone has suggestions on how to successfully pivot into tech, especially as an entry level developer, I would be happy to have some guidance! 
# Thanks for getting to know me!
